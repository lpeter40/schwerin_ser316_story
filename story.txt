Hans was a hund traveling through Germany.
He wanted to get some gebaeck.
But Hans got lost in the biergarten.
So he ordered a bratwurst and brot!
Hans saw that people in the biergarten were wearing Drindl and Lederhose.
Excited by all the people, he joined a Wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating team.
They met on Hauptstrasse and everyone wore Lederhoses.
They asked Hans if he wanted to go to Berlin with them.
Then they decided to go to a Ratskeller and to eat some Apfelkuchen
But the Apfelkuchen wasn’t good so he threw it at a passing BMW.  
Professor Melhase was driving the BMW with her Klimaanlage off and her windows down.
