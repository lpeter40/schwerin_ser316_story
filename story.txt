Hans was a hund traveling through Germany.
He wanted to get some gebaeck.
But Hans got lost in the biergarten.
So he ordered a bratwurst and brot!
Hans saw that people in the biergarten were wearing Drindl and Lederhose.
Excited by all the people, he joined a Wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating team.
They met on Hauptstrasse and everyone wore Lederhoses.
They asked Hans if he wanted to go to Berlin with them.
But the Apfelkuchen wasn’t good so he threw it at a passing BMW.
