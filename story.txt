Hans was a hund traveling through Germany.
He wanted to get some gebaeck.
But Hans got lost in the biergarten.
So he ordered a bratwurst and brot!
Hans saw that people in the biergarten were wearing Drindl and Lederhose.
Excited by all the people, he joined a Wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating team.
They met on Hauptstrasse and everyone wore Lederhoses.
