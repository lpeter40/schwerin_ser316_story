Hans was a hund traveling through Germany.
He wanted to get some gebaeck.
But Hans got lost in the biergarten.
So he ordered a bratwurst and brot!
Hans saw that people in the biergarten were wearing Drindl and Lederhose.
Excited by all the people, he joined a Wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating team.
They met on Hauptstrasse and everyone wore Lederhoses.
They asked Hans if he wanted to go to Berlin with them.
Then they decided to go to a Ratskeller and to eat some Apfelkuchen
But the Apfelkuchen wasn’t good so he threw it at a passing BMW.
Professor Melhase was driving the BMW with her Klimaanlage off and her windows down.
Moments later, he was shocked to find the Apfelkuchen still in his clutches and fell silent at the sight of his delicious Döner sliding down the side of the BMW.
Suddenly he realized he was wearing a Dirndl instead of Lederhoses, and he didn't know how that happened.
